# IOT Electronic Wheelchair App

The purpose of this Flutter app is to use Bluetooth to operate an electric wheelchair.  It was created in the **second year, second semester** as a component of our **Internet of Things (IoT)** program.  An **ESP32 board** and **IR sensors** power the wheelchair, enabling users to control mobility via an app.

## Features
- **Bluetooth Connectivity** â€“ Seamlessly connects to the ESP32 board.
- **Wheelchair Movement Control** â€“ Navigate the wheelchair remotely.
- **ESP32 Device Control** â€“ Can also control other ESP32-based moving components.
